# Hello, World! I might say
### In this repo, as the description already told you. This repo includes all of the basics that you wanna need on your way to making an easier life for yourself. 

As you may already know, these days. It's useless to create every single file by yourself. 
So, I've created this repo to help you out with that.

## What's included?
- [x] .gitignore - **Just ignore, nothing special there lol**
- [x] README.md - **Which is basically this file**
- [x] LICENSE   - **Well there should be no license but there will just in case**
"# html-template"
